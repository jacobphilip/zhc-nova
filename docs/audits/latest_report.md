- Terminal/Daemon Interfaces: 7.8/10 (weight 6%, contribution 4.68)

## Evidence Notes

- `terminal_daemon_interfaces`: Telegram long-poll runtime and startup handlers are implemented in `services/telegram-control/bot_longpoll.py` with service template `infra/zeroclaw/systemd/zhc-telegram-control.service`.
- `lightweight_runtime`: Ubuntu-first single-node execution path is implemented in `services/task-router/router.py` via `ZHC_RUNTIME_MODE=single_node` and documented in `docs/DEPLOYMENT_UBUNTU.md`.
- `multi_agent_swarm`: planner/reviewer gate, fail taxonomy, and checklist enforcement are implemented in `services/task-router/router.py` and reflected in `services/telegram-control/commands.md`.
- `hybrid_memory_compression`: improved compaction ratio and token telemetry are generated by `services/task-router/router.py` and reported in `docs/audits/metrics/latest_metrics.md`.
- `closed_loop_feedback`: recurring metrics and audit loop is active through `scripts/metrics_report.py`, `make metrics`, and `make audit`.
