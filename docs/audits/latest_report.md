## Lowest Metrics (Priority Fixes)

- Ethical/Auditable Governance: 8.0/10 (weight 5%, contribution 4.00)
- Cost Optimization: 7.4/10 (weight 6%, contribution 4.44)
- Terminal/Daemon Interfaces: 7.8/10 (weight 6%, contribution 4.68)

## Evidence Notes

- `terminal_daemon_interfaces`: long-poll runtime and hardening live in `services/telegram-control/bot_longpoll.py` and `infra/zeroclaw/systemd/zhc-telegram-control.service`.
- `closed_loop_feedback`: rolling/dated metrics are generated by `scripts/metrics_report.py` with outputs in `docs/audits/metrics/latest_metrics.json` and `docs/audits/metrics/2026-02-25-v1_1_metrics.json`.
- `cost_optimization`: OpenRouter-enriched pricing is active (`cost_source_counts.openrouter_api=7`) in `docs/audits/metrics/latest_metrics.json`.
- `multi_agent_swarm`: planner/reviewer gate with fail taxonomy/checklist enforced in `services/task-router/router.py` and surfaced through `services/telegram-control/bot_longpoll.py`.
- `hybrid_memory_compression`: compaction ratio improvements (`avg_compression_ratio=0.7074`) are reported in `docs/audits/metrics/latest_metrics.md` and implemented in `services/task-router/router.py`.
