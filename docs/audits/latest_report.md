## Evidence Notes

- `terminal_daemon_interfaces`: validated live Telegram command flow (`/start`, `/help`, `/newtask`, `/approve`, `/plan`, `/review`, `/resume`, `/status`, `/board`) through `services/telegram-control/bot_longpoll.py`.
- `lightweight_runtime`: Ubuntu-first local heavy execution is active via `ZHC_RUNTIME_MODE=single_node` and local wrapper path in `services/task-router/router.py`.
- `multi_agent_swarm`: planner/reviewer gate with fail taxonomy and checklist enforcement is implemented in `services/task-router/router.py` and exposed in `services/telegram-control/commands.md`.
- `closed_loop_feedback`: metrics rollups include Telegram success/error rates and gate stats in `docs/audits/metrics/latest_metrics.json` generated by `scripts/metrics_report.py`.
- `cost_optimization` and `hybrid_memory_compression`: OpenRouter-enriched pricing coverage and compaction ratio metrics are tracked in `docs/audits/metrics/latest_metrics.json` and produced by `services/task-router/router.py`.
